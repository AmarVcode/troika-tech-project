				"text": "Choose a Girl \nShe quickly rose to internet fame when her hilarious sleepwalking escapades went viral online. Since then, she has decided to derive humor from her sleepwalking disorder and document them on TikTok, to the amusement of her viewers and growing followers. Between her slender figure, expressive eyes, and pouty lips, it’s easy to see why her millions of followers get so wrapped up in her content. When it comes to engagement rates, data shows that girl Tiktokers tend to perform better than men on average across categories such as activity rate, comment rate, view rate, and like rate. This is likely due in part to the fact that many girl Tiktokers rely on emotional storytelling techniques in their videos which can lead to greater viewer engagement. Additionally, recent studies indicate that audiences are often more drawn to videos featuring girl Tiktokers which can lead them to attain higher levels of success more quickly than their male counterparts. \nHottest Girls To Follow On TikTok\n\nGirls who are online now \n\nAMAZING LUSTFUL CUTIE baby_and_lina   \n        Write to her Now         \nADDICTION TO SEX  \n THE RIPEST FRUIT YOU’VE EVER TASTED \n This erotic princess is waiting for you and ready to fulfill any wish  \n𝐒𝐔𝐁𝐒𝐂𝐑𝐈𝐁𝐄 \nbaby_and_lina \nbaby_and_lina \n \n    \n\n\n\nDon’t miss it christie_angel \n        Write to her Now         \nShe baby_kris_love needs your cock more than ever \nThis cutie loves to play with her tight holes. \nShe baby_kris_love will take any pose to make your balls empty \n𝐒𝐔𝐁𝐒𝐂𝐑𝐈𝐁𝐄 \nchristie_angel \nchristie_angel \n \n    \n\n\n\n STOP SCROLLING  lera_vip \n        Write to her Now         \n Her wet pussy is waiting for your cock lera_vip  \nThis perfect figure lera_vip is made to please you.

Also known as NUPS, Nupur has a striking sense of style that blends the modern, the edgy, and the urban into a sexy masterpiece. Her claim to fame as a highly skilled makeup artist got her tons of fans with the ladies, but her stunningly statuesque body was what caught male attention. «You think a rat thinks twice before stealing a slice of pizza?» she asks rhetorically, recalling New York City’s infamous Pizza Rat. Leinna is one of those models who boasts a name just as exotic as her looks — and we mean that in the best way possible. Her beautiful blue eyes and long brown hair would make anyone feel a little hot under the collar. \nDOMINIK LIPA @domelipa (41.4M) – Top TikTok Girls 2024\nAdditionally, the app is designed for making and sharing creative content which TikTok models love. This means that users can be creative with their videos and posts, which helps TikTok models to stand out from the crowd. She has over 54 million followers on the app and has parlayed that into modeling contracts, brand sponsorships, and a music career. Another popular TikTok girl is Baby Ariel, who has over 36 million followers and was one of the first people to be signed by musical.ly (which merged with TikTok in 2018). Shilpa Shetty is a multi-awarded, famous Indian celebrity and one of the most popular TikTok girls in 2022, who has been in the entertainment industry for more than 22 years. \n\nNow a certified singer, she has signed a deal with Warner Records and released her debut single “Build a Bitch in May 2021.\nCompiled from fan-voted ranks, we are looking for the consistent ability to entertain and engage an audience, and the stars who have effectively used the short-video platform to skyrocket their fame.\nShe has over 54 million followers on the app and has parlayed that into modeling contracts, brand sponsorships, and a music career.\nIn the Hulu original horror franchise Freakish, Liza played Violet Adams; in the horror-comedy film she portrayed Aday Walker, and in the YouTube series “Jingle Ballin’,” she played herself.\n\nThis connection is key to building a following on social media, and some of the most famous TikTok girls have mastered it. The amount of money that girl Tiktokers stars can earn from any of these methods also varies depending on their level of influence and follower count. Generally speaking, the larger the audience size of girl Tiktokers, the more likely they are to attract potential sponsorships or be able to negotiate higher payouts for their content. \n\nShe quickly rose to internet fame when her hilarious sleepwalking escapades went viral online.\nThe hottest Tik Tok users provide content that is often highly entertaining and engaging.\nThey have a natural ability to engage with their audience and make them feel like they are part of the conversation.\nWith the overflowing love and acceptance she receives from her audiences, she has learned to love and considered TikTok a home.\n\nLoren Gray joined TikTok in 2015 when it was originally called Musical.ly and had been the most-followed TikTok individual from March 31, 2019, to March 25, 2020. Valeria Arguelles got her start in fame through YouTube, where she became known for her personal adventure, lifestyle, and fashion vlogging. The YouTuber’s fame didn’t end there; she quickly landed modeling gigs and a part in Project 305 thanks to her magnetic personality and photo-ready appearance. As one of the hottest girls on Instagram and a newly risen TikTok star, you might find it hard to believe that she is a genuinely wonderful person to follow regardless of your sexual orientation. Thanks to her heartfelt posts, her warm personality, and her visually appealing way of presenting herself, her content makes her feel like the friend you wish you had. \nBy doing this the hottest Tik Tok users can benefit from each other’s following while still providing unique content that viewers enjoy watching. Moreover, these collaborations with the hottest Tik Tok users also allow creators to reach a larger audience while also allowing them to build relationships outside of the platform. In addition to this type of collaboration, many of the most popular TikTok dancers have developed personal brands that extend beyond just dance videos. Arishfa Khan is an 18-year-old actress, model, and one of India’s most popular TikTok Girls. She began her career as a child actor in 2012 and appeared in several TV serials, commercials, as well as music videos. On TikTok, Arishfa, one of the most famous TikTok girls in 2022, is fond of posting lip-sync, funny skits, and dance videos.",

				"text": "The Grévin wax museum in Paris has honored Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan with a customized gold coin inscribed with his name. This accolade recognizes Khan’s significant contributions to world cinema. The museum, which already features a wax statue of Khan, added this honor as a special tribute. Other Bollywood celebrities, such as Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Ranveer Singh, have also been celebrated by the museum, but Khan is reportedly the first Indian celebrity to receive this specific honor. \n\n\n\nRead More: Sania Mirza gives a glimpse of her relaxed moments \n\n\n\nAt 58, Shah Rukh Khan made a triumphant return to the big screen in 2023 after a five-year hiatus, starring in three major releases: Pathaan, Jawan, and Dunki. Both Pathaan and Jawan were blockbuster hits. Khan also made a cameo appearance in the film Tiger 3. Looking ahead, he is set to star in an action film titled King, which will also feature his daughter, Suhana Khan, and actor Abhishek Bachchan.",

				"text": "The release of a private video featuring Urvashi Rautela has caused a major uproar, capturing the attention of the internet. The video depicts the actress in her bathroom, seemingly preparing to take a shower. Initially, many speculated that it might be a random clip from one of her old movies, but it has been revealed that this is not the case. The authenticity of the video, whether it is real or created using AI or deepfake technology, is still being investigated.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nA post shared by Bollywoodflash (@bollywoodflash01) \n\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, Urvashi Rautela is not the only Indian celebrity to have been targeted by such incidents. Other stars like Samantha Ruth Prabhu, Alia Bhatt, Kajol, Katrina Kaif, and Rashmika Mandanna have also faced similar situations, with explicit images/videos going viral online. The industry is grappling with the challenge of determining the authenticity of these content leaks.The controversial video showcases Urvashi Rautela entering a bathroom while dressed in an orange kurta. What has caught people’s attention is the neckpiece she is wearing, resembling a ‘mangal sutra.’ She proceeds to hang her towel and admires herself in the mirror before undressing. The video ends before anything explicit is shown.\n\nThe accidental exposure of this video has sent shockwaves throughout the industry, sparking intense debates about its authenticity and whether Urvashi Rautela may have orchestrated a publicity stunt. Some social media users criticized the actress, accusing her of resorting to cheap stunts or suggesting that she should try different methods to gain attention. While many have shared their opinions on the matter, Urvashi Rautela herself has yet to address the controversy. As the industry and fans await her response, it remains to be seen how this incident will impact her career and public image.On the professional front, Urvashi Rautela was last seen in the political drama Jahangir National University, where she starred alongside Siddharth Bodke in the lead role.",

The world could wait; for now, the cat was content to bask in the simple pleasure of the sun’s warmth on its fur. In that tranquil moment, all worries and cares seemed to fade away, replaced by a sense of calm and serenity. The cat’s body seemed to meld with the earth beneath it, becoming one with nature in a peaceful and harmonious union. And so, in that quiet corner of the world, the cat sat, a picture of tranquility and contentment, lost in the beauty of the moment. \nThe post Sharvari Secures #1 Spot On IMDB’s  Indian Celebrity List appeared first on Blog.",

The newlyweds have heaped praise on Nita Ambani, the groom’s mother, for the way the festivities turned out. \n“My mother-in-law was the C.E.O. of the wedding, as I like to say,” Merchant told Vogue in an exclusive interview. “It was Nita’s commitment and vision that brought our entire celebration to life.” \nNita Ambani oversaw the planning of the wedding festivities alongside her daughter, Isha Ambani, and her daughter-in-law, Shloka Ambani, Merchant said. \nIn addition to their in-house staff, the Ambanis also engaged the help of event planners to pull off the celebrations, per Vogue. The festivities took place over multiple weeks and culminated in a three-day wedding ceremony in Mumbai over the weekend. \nThe couple kicked off the festivities with a pre-wedding party in March, which featured some 1,200 guests, including business leaders like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates. \nDuring a speech at the pre-wedding bash, Anant thanked his mother for working tirelessly over months to make the party happen. \n“All this is created by my mother and no one else, and my mother has gone all out for the last four months,” Anant can be heard saying in a video of the speech uploaded in March. “She’s worked for, I think, 18, 19 hours a day, and I’m extremely grateful to Mama. Thank you so much.” \nAmbani’s pre-wedding parties included performances from Justin Bieber and Rihanna, among other celebrities. \nShadows, chefs, technicians: The staff behind a massive wedding\nWhile the newlyweds have been generous in their praise of Nita’s work for the wedding, it takes a massive crew of professionals to pull off such an event. A multi-day Indian celebrity wedding can require around 500 staff, wedding planners previously told Business Insider. \nIn addition to chefs, waiters, decorators, and technicians, each main family member may also be assigned a personal butler, or “shadow,” during the wedding to manage their needs, from holding their phones to ensuring hydration, the wedding planners said. Top security firms and local authorities may even be engaged to protect high-profile guests. \nThe planners BI spoke to said a typical three-day wedding that they plan costs about $1.2 million. A spokesperson for the Ambanis did not respond to a request for comment about the costs for Anant’s wedding, which was hosted at the Ambani-owned Jio World Convention Centre. \nThe wedding festivities sparked some controversy over the weekend due to disruptions caused by traffic diversions and road closures. Nevertheless, the planners BI spoke to expect the scale of the wedding to leave a global impact on the wedding-planning industry. \n“Given the immense influence celebrities have, their weddings often become blueprints for future celebrations worldwide,” Bharat Jagasia, a Delhi-based wedding planner, told BI. \nRead the original article on Business Insider",

The Ambanis have hired Rihanna, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, The Backstreet Boys, and Pitbull for pre-wedding functions in recent months. \nOther families spend a lot on artists including singers and celebrity DJs, said Purvi Modgil, a destination wedding planner based in Mumbai. \n“If you plan to call three or four of them in different core functions, that can also add up to a good cost,” she said. \nThe remaining 10% usually goes into wedding gifts and logistics for the family and guests. \n“Now, when it comes to a high-net-worth wedding or a celebrity wedding, everything becomes 10 times or hundred times” of that cost, Aggarwal said. “There is no bar on the budget.” \nPlanners’ cost estimates of the Ambani wedding varied widely, from tens of millions of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars. \nAnant’s older sister Isha Ambani got married in 2018 in a similarly lavish wedding, including a Beyoncé performance. While media outlets speculated about a $100 million price tag, a spokesperson for the Ambani-owned company, Reliance, said that it cost less than $15 million, per a Forbes article at the time. \nA spokesperson for the family did not respond to a request for comment about the costs for Anant Ambani’s wedding. \nThe pre-wedding events have grabbed headlines for months. With so many celebrities and business leaders angling for an invitation, the nuptials are also a business networking event, Aggarwal said. \nEach main family member is assigned a ‘shadow’\nMany couples don’t want to host their weddings at venues where other high-profile families have already held nuptials, Aggarwal said. \n“They want everything to be exclusive,” she said. “The decor has to be something else that no one else has ever thought of. It is almost like a big movie set.” \nFor a big celebrity wedding, planners divide their staff into teams and hire hundreds of additional people leading up to and on the day of the ceremony. \nWith chefs, waiters, light and audio teams, and decorators, about 500 people often work the event, Modgil said. \nThe planners also assign butlers to each main family member. These staffers, called “shadows,” hold their phones and gifts and ensure they stay hydrated and have everything they need. \n“There are over 70 suppliers and vendors who we work with for each wedding,” said Darshan Shroff, a Mumbai-based wedding planner. “I like to describe wedding planners in India as circus masters.” \nPrivacy and security are top concerns\nMany celebrity or influencer couples are particular about how their wedding is portrayed on the news and on social media. \nPlanners have strict instructions that restrict posts from vendors about outfits, decor, or flowers before a set date. Most big weddings also collect the phones of their guests for privacy, and couples have teams that work with the media. \n“You can’t have too many people hanging out taking their pictures. It makes them very uncomfortable,” Modgil said about celebrity guests and couples. \nTop security firms and even local authorities may sketch out safety plans. \n“The minute there are some kind of celebrities, whether it’s politicians or Bollywood, security becomes very important,” Modgil said. “We’ve had separate people escorting them and even taking them back because sometimes they even get mobbed.“ \nThe families and their guests are not always easy to please. \nAggarwal said she has planned weddings where celebrity attendees call to confirm what type of hotel suite they will be staying in and what kind of car is coming to pick them up. Everything must match their lifestyle standard. \nSetting a blueprint for other weddings\nThe Ambani wedding is already influencing how other Indians are envisioning and planning their own nuptials. \nThe planners told BI that brides are asking them for the same designers that Radhika Merchant wore in her pre-wedding events, like the custom lehengas designed by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla and Tarun Tahiliani. \nRadhika Merchant wore a Swarovski crystal lehenga designed by Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla. \nAshish Vaishnav via Getty Image \nPlanners expect the main wedding to leave an even bigger mark. \n“Given the immense influence celebrities have, their weddings often become blueprints for future celebrations worldwide,” said Bharat Jagasia, a Delhi-based wedding planner. \n“For the Ambani wedding, I am particularly excited to see how they differentiate the main event from their pre-wedding functions,” he said. \nThe festivities are slated to kick off Friday at the Jio World Convention Centre, which is owned by the Ambani family. It can accommodate over 16,000 guests. \nRead the original article on Business Insider",

				"text": "Introduction\nInnovation and creativity regularly cross paths in programming languages in shocking methods. One such occasion is the pc language Rajini++, which drew inspiration from the well-known strains of South Indian film star Rajinikanth. Aadhithya Sankar’s playful and distinctive esoteric programming language Rajini++ (or Rajinipp) is a tribute to the long-lasting actor. Rajini++ provides followers and programmers a enjoyable and thrilling approach to mix their love of Rajinikanth with their ardour for coding, although it’s not meant for critical software program improvement. \nOverview\n\nDiscover Rajini++, a playful programming language impressed by the long-lasting dialogues of South Indian celebrity Rajinikanth.\nLearn the way Rajini++ makes use of Rajinikanth’s well-known film strains in its syntax.\nUncover the important thing options of Rajini++, together with math operations, management constructions, and capabilities.\nPerceive the set up steps and check out pattern codes in Rajini++.\n\nOrigin and Inspiration for Rajini++\nRajinikanth, popularly generally known as “Thalaiva” by his followers, is the inspiration behind Rajini++ due to his charisma and larger-than-life demeanor. His dialogues, famend for his or her theatrical aptitude and punch, have been included on this language’s syntax and directions. The creator, Aadhithya Sankar, wished to create a coding expertise that appealed to followers and coders by encapsulating the essence of Rajinikanth’s type. \nAadhithya Sankar, in his article, states, “The origins of rajini++ return six years to after I first got here throughout this esolang known as ArnoldC. Proper from that second, I had wished to create such an esolang for the celebrity. Six years and a variety of learnings later, right here we’re, lastly with a usable model of the Rajini++ language.” \nKey Options and Syntax of Rajini++\nRajini++ is constructed on prime of Python, requiring a model better than 3.8 or lower than 3.11. It provides a number of basic programming options: \n\nMath Operations: SUM, SUB, MUL, DIV, MOD\nUnary Operations: SUM and SUB\nVariable Declaration and Manipulation\nManagement Constructions: If-Else statements, For loop and Whereas loops\nCapabilities: With and with out arguments, return values\n\nThe syntax of Rajini++ incorporates Rajinikanth’s dialogues, making coding classes paying homage to the celebrity’s film scenes. \nSet up and Getting Began\n\n\nMaking certain Python model compatibility \nTest your Python model is between 3.8 and fewer than 3.11 to make sure compatibility. Run python --version or python3 --versionto test. \n\nPutting in Rajinipp\nUse the pip set up rajinipp command to put in Rajinipp. \n\nVerification of Set up\nTest the set up by operating rajinipp model to see the put in model. \n\n\n\nPattern Codes for Rajini++\nNow that we now have put in and arrange the atmosphere. Let’s strive some primary pattern codes \n, comparable to hello_world.pp \nLAKSHMI START\nDOT \"Hiya, World!\";\nMAGIZHCHI\n\nWithin the above code,, LAKSHMI START will point out the, program’s begin and MAGIZHCHI will signify the top. \n\nif_conditional.rpp \nLAKSHMI START\nAANDAVAN SOLLRAN x ARUNACHALAM SEIYARAN 15;\n!! if assertion.\nDOT \"Instance: If Assertion\";\nEN PEAR MANICKAM x > 10{\n    DOT \"x (\" x \") is bigger than 10!\";\n} KATHAM KATHAM;\nDOT \"\";\n!!

Please confer with the official wiki to remain up to date on the newest adjustments. This language is extra of a tribute and a passion venture than a device for critical software program improvement. \nConclusion\nRajini++ is a enjoyable fusion of programming and popular culture that provides followers of Rajinikanth and programmers a brand new approach to work together with each realms. It is probably not acceptable for skilled software program improvement, however its inventiveness and the enjoyment it takes from coding make it interesting.

				"title": "AI-Generated Impersonations: Violations of Publicity Rights Or Passing Off?",
				"text": "The post is authored by A.S. Vamsi Krishna, a 4th year law student at RGNUL, Punjab. \n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\nOn 15th May 2024, the Delhi HC passed an order in favour of the Indian celebrity Jackie Shroff, protecting his right to publicity against impersonation of his persona (voice, image and likeness) by websites using generative AI programs for marketing, and other commercial usage. This decision represents a paradigm shift in how Indian courts handle copyright infringements where AI is used to replicate the persona of a celebrity without their permission. In past decisions like Anil Kapoor Film Co (P) Ltd v Make My Day Entertainment (Anil Kapoor v Make My Day), Indian courts have categorised violations of a celebrity’s persona as passing off rather than a violation of publicity rights. The difference in treatment is relevant since the categorisation of the infringement determines how the remedy may be availed including the extent of its applicability as well as the requisite evidentiary threshold. In this piece, the author supports the Delhi HC’s decision, contending that the impersonation of a person’s persona (i.e., voice, image or likeness) should be addressed as a violation of their publicity rights, rather than being categorised as passing off. \n\n\n\nThe Problem with Categorising AI Generated Impersonations as Passing Off\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nPassing off generally refers to the marketing of a product that is deceptively similar to someone else’s product, causing confusion among consumers. This concept is particularly relevant when the concerned intellectual property is not registered. The judicial categorization of impersonations as passing off stems from this idea, since likeness or voice are inherent traits of a person and not creative works, making them non-registrable under Section 13 of the Copyright Act 1957 (Copyright Act). English courts favour this approach as seen in Sim v H.J. Heinz, where the court noted that using someone’s voice without consent for monetary gain would be considered passing off one’s persona. In Anil Kapoor v Make My Day, the Bombay HC affirmed this approach. The Court held that the impersonation of a celebrity’s image, voice, or likeness for commercial usage would find remedy under passing off. \n\n\n\nHowever, the categorisation of AI-generated impersonations as passing off would be inappropriate since the rigorous test for proving passing off would severely limit the applicability and efficacy of the remedy. The test for proving passing off requires the fulfilment of three elements– first, goodwill/reputation is associated with the person; second, misrepresentation leading the public to believe the person is associated with the impersonator; third, some form of damage has been inflicted to the person.  This test is known as the classical trinity and is notoriously difficult to prove since the evidential burden of proof is upon the person alleging that the infringement took place. Consequently, the affected person seeking protection would have to go through a laborious litigation process. The difficulty associated in availing the remedy may discourage some, thus reducing the efficacy of the remedy. Further, the ingredient of misrepresentation is particularly problematic, as it significantly limits the availability of remedies. This limitation arises where the impersonator explicitly discloses that the voice was generated by an AI program, it negates the element of misrepresentation. In other words, the impersonator can easily circumvent the misrepresentation element, and thus the passing off claim, by simply adding a disclaimer about the artificial origin of the impersonation. . Nonetheless, this does not diminish the unethical nature of the unauthorised use of their persona. For instance, an AI-generated parody audio that impersonates a person, even with a disclaimer of its artificial origin, still infringes upon the moral rights of the individual. \n\n\n\nThe Better Alternative: Publicity Rights\n\n\n\nThe right of publicity refers to the legal right conferred to individuals which grants them the exclusive authority to authorise or prohibit the use of their persona for commercial purposes. US courts have preferred this approach, as evidenced in White v Samsung Electronics America, where the court held that impersonations of a person’s likeness or voice in commercials violate their publicity rights. The issue of AI-generated impersonation was raised in Main Sequence Ltd. v. Dudesy LLC, where the legal representatives of the late comedian George Carlin sued a podcast company for publishing an AI-generated comedy special featuring Carlin’s persona. Although the parties later settled, leaving the jurisprudence on this topic unclear, the court’s ruling in White v. Samsung clearly indicates that the right of publicity is a valid ground to sue for AI-based impersonations. \n\n\n\nIn K.S. Puttaswamy v Union of India, the Indian Supreme Court recognised the right of publicity as a fundamental right and held that any person who has an enforceable right on the persona (either the person or his legal representatives) can prevent unauthorised use of the persona. However, since the case did not actually revolve around the issue of celebrity rights, there is a risk that lower courts may ignore it, considering it to be obiter dictum. Resolving this issue, the Delhi HC in Anil Kapoor v. SimplyLife recognized that infringement of publicity rights constitutes valid grounds for granting an injunction against impersonators using AI-generated images and videos to replicate a celebrity’s persona for marketing their own products. Additionally, the Court differentiated this remedy from passing off by stating that proof of misrepresentation or falsification was not required. Thus, categorising AI-generated impersonations under infringement of publicity rights, rather than passing off, broadens the scope of available remedies by eliminating the need to prove misrepresentation. Additionally, publicity rights encompass more than just reactive measures, as seen in passing off cases where legal action can only be taken post unauthorised use. They also offer proactive protection, granting individuals the authority to control and monetize their identity by licensing it for commercial usage. \n\n\n\nConclusion \n\n\n\nThe Delhi High Court’s decision affirming publicity rights sets an important precedent for addressing copyright infringements involving AI-generated impersonations of individuals in advertisements, chatbots, merchandising, and other deceptive practices. From the discussion above, it is evident that the remedy under publicity rights is preferable to passing off due to its balanced evidentiary threshold, broader applicability, and enhanced rights. A decisive ruling by the apex court in favor of publicity rights would mark a significant milestone in protecting intellectual property against AI exploitation. Furthermore, addressing this issue requires more than just court rulings; governmental action vis-à-vis legislation is essential to provide specific remedies against AI-generated impersonation of persona. States like Tennessee have already enacted regulations, such as the Ensuring Likeness, Voice, and Image Security (ELVIS) Act of 2024 , to address AI-generated impersonations, which allows victims to seek civil remedies, including punitive damages, against offenders who misrepresent their identity using generative AI. Such laws not only serve as ex-post remedies but also deter impersonation by establishing clear legal consequences.",

				"title": "MG Astor Review: The Quirky SUV with a Techy Twist and a Heart of Gold",
				"text": "Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, gather ’round for the grand unveiling of the MG Astor – the car that’s here to revolutionize your driving experience and maybe even make you laugh along the way. Picture this: a Chinese SUV strutting down the runway with the confidence of a supermodel and the charm of a stand-up comedian. Yes, folks, it’s the MG ZS Astor! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA History Lesson (But Fun!)\n\n\n\nFirst hitting the roads in 2017, the Astor has been a crowd-pleaser ever since. Fast forward to 2024, and we’re gazing upon the first-generation facelift variant – think of it as the Astor with a fresh new haircut and a cheeky smile. Exclusively a petrol beast, the range starts at a modest INR 10 lakh (ex-showroom), while the top-of-the-line Savvy Pro model demands a princely sum of INR 17.89 lakh. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Electrifying Twin\n\n\n\nDid you know the Astor has a sibling with a green thumb? Meet the ZS EV, starting at INR 19 lakh. It’s the environmentally conscious sibling who’s always reminding you to recycle and turn off the lights when you leave the room. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational Fame\n\n\n\nThe Astor isn’t just an Indian celebrity; it’s a global sensation! Known as MG ZX, ZST, or VS in various countries, it’s the international equivalent of that friend who has different nicknames in every group. Assembled in India, China, Thailand, Taiwan, and Indonesia, the Astor is a true globetrotter. \n\n\n\nSafety Ratings: Mixed Reviews\n\n\n\nSafety-wise, the Astor has been through the wringer. Euro NCAP gave it a “meh” 3 out of 5 stars, while ASEAN NCAP showered it with a perfect 5 out of 5. It’s like that one kid in school who gets a gold star from some teachers and a “needs improvement” from others. \n\n\n\nThe ADAS Extravaganza\n\n\n\nMG Astor comes with ADAS Level 2, which is a fancy way of saying it has a bunch of features that make you feel like you’re in a sci-fi movie. Lane Departure Warning, Forward Collision Warning, and Automatic Emergency Braking – it’s like having a very cautious and somewhat paranoid co-pilot. \n\n\n\nVariant Bonanza\n\n\n\nAstor now comes in five flavors: Sprint, Shine, Select, Sharp Pro, and Savvy Pro. Think of them as ice cream flavors – each one a little different, but all guaranteed to make your drive deliciously smooth. \n\n\n\nExterior: The Show-Off\n\n\n\nWith features like fog lamps with cornering function, celestial grille, and automatic full LED hawkeye headlamps, the Astor is basically peacocking on the road. Rain-sensing wipers and power-adjustable, foldable heated mirrors with turn indicators and cameras – it’s like having a tiny butler for your car. \n\n\n\nSize Does Matter\n\n\n\nAt 4.3 meters in length, 1.8 meters in width, and 1.6 meters in height, the Astor is just the right size to make you feel like a road king without the hassle of parking a tank. \n\n\n\nWheels and Brakes: Fancy Feet\n\n\n\nRiding on 17-inch dual-tone machined alloy wheels (or 16-inch steel wheels if you’re feeling basic), with disc brakes all around, the Astor is ready to dance. Red brake calipers are the cherry on top for those who like a pop of color.

				"title": "The Impact of Celebrity Endorsements in Advertising",
				"text": "In the dynamic landscape of Indian advertising, celebrity endorsements stand as beacons of influence, guiding brand narratives and captivating audiences nationwide. From iconic actors to sporting legends, Indian celebrities wield significant power in shaping consumer perceptions and driving brand engagement. Let’s delve into the world of Indian celebrity ads and explore how these influential figures leave an enduring mark on marketing campaigns. \nIndian celebrity ads are more than just promotional tools; they are powerful storytelling vehicles. Whether it’s the charisma of Amitabh Bachchan or the elegance of Deepika Padukone, these ads weave narratives that resonate deeply with audiences. By blending star power with relatable storytelling, brands create emotional connections that resonate long after the ad ends. \nThe allure of Indian celebrity ads lies in their ability to tap into cultural nuances and societal trends. From traditional festivals to modern lifestyles, these ads reflect the rich tapestry of Indian life. By aligning with cultural moments and values, brands position themselves as integral parts of consumers’ daily experiences, fostering trust and loyalty. \nFurthermore, Indian celebrity ads often serve as aspirational symbols for viewers. Whether it’s Ranveer Singh endorsing a fashion brand or PV Sindhu promoting a sports equipment line, these ads evoke desires for success, style, and achievement. Aspirational numbers help brands connect with consumers’ aspirations and increase their appeal. \nHowever, credibility and genuineness are essential for Indian celebrity advertisements to succeed. Audiences now expect brands to be transparent and to build real relationships with them in an era of increased consumer knowledge. Therefore, in order to ensure authenticity and resonance with their target audience, brands need to carefully choose superstars whose values match their own. \nThere are risks associated with Indian celebrity commercials, even with their huge appeal. Celebrities are not immune to controversies, and any misstep can damage a brand’s reputation. Therefore, brands must conduct thorough due diligence and choose celebrities who are not only influential but also reliable and trustworthy partners. \nIn summary, Indian celebrity ads represent a potent force in advertising, blending star power with relatable storytelling to create impactful campaigns. By tapping into cultural nuances, evoking aspirations, and prioritizing authenticity, brands can leverage the influence of Indian celebrities to forge deep connections with audiences. With the right approach, Indian celebrity ads have the potential to captivate hearts and minds, leaving a lasting impression that extends far beyond the screen. \n  \nThe post The Impact of Celebrity Endorsements in Advertising appeared first on Abusinessventure.",

				"title": "Bollywood to Billboards: How Indian Celebrities Add Spice to Advertising",
				"text": "Hello, advertising aficionados! Have you ever wondered why Indian advertisements feel like mini Bollywood movies? Well, it’s not just your imagination— Indian celebrities and advertising go together like chai and biscuits. It’s an open secret that in India, celebrity endorsements are not just a tactic but an entire strategy wrapped in glam and glitz. Here’s the lowdown on how these stars light up the world of Indian commercials. Grab your popcorn, and let’s unravel this star-studded drama! \n\n\n\nFlashy, Sassy and Oh So Classy!\n\n\n\nFirst thing’s first: charisma. When these celebs waltz onto your TV screen with their designer clothes and million-dollar smiles, it’s hard not to drop what you’re doing and take notice. They’ve got charm and they’re not afraid to use it! Using Indian celebrity ads is like the marketing equivalent of a masala movie—it has all the right ingredients to catch your attention and leave you craving for more. \n\n\n\nRelatability Meets Royalty\n\n\n\nIt’s a peculiar affair, really. Even though these celebrities live lives that are miles away from the average Indian, advertisers masterfully weave narratives that position these stars in everyday scenarios. Picture this: a famous actress arguing over the perfect spice level in her sambar, or a leading cricketer facing the terror of a washing machine. Suddenly, they’re not just stars—they are people just like us (but with better hair)! \n\n\n\nThe Ripple Effect of Star Power\n\n\n\nWhen a big name from the silver screen pitches a product, it doesn’t just stay within the confines of those who tune in; it becomes a household discussion topic. From chai-time gossip to office water-cooler chat, everyone’s got an opinion on the latest ad. The effectiveness of celebrity endorsements can be debated, but their ability to start conversations? Absolutely not! \n\n\n\nA Spoonful of Stardom\n\n\n\nUsing celebrities in ads is also a sneaky way for brands to add a spoonful of stardom to their products. Think about it—would you not feel just a tiny bit more fabulous using the same face cream as the heartthrob of the nation? It’s not just advertising; it’s like a fairy dust sprinkle of glamour onto mundane daily goods. \n\n\n\nThe Twist in the Plot\n\n\n\nBut here comes the twist – not all that glitters in Indian celebrity ads is gold. Consumers are becoming savvier, and there’s a growing demand for authenticity and real connections. Brands now face the challenge of not just grabbing attention with star power but also crafting compelling stories that resonate and create genuine engagement. \n\n\n\nWrap Up with A Dance Number\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, much like any Bollywood blockbuster that ends with a dance number, Indian celebrities in advertisements leave a memorable imprint. They bring the flair, the drama, and the emotions, turning bland commercials into buzz-worthy spectacles. Will this trend continue? As long as there are stories to tell and stars to showcase, the sage of glitzy endorsements is far from over. \n\n\n\nSo, next time you see a commercial break rolling on your screen, watch out for the stars. Not up above, but right there—dancing, laughing, and selling, all in that charismatic Bollywood style!",

				"title": "Sheena Chohan Accepts Award from US President Biden – Calls for Mandatory Human Rights Education in India",
				"text": "Actress Sheena Chohan was given The President’s Lifetime Achievement Award from the President of the United States, Joseph Biden, at a ceremony on 8th June in the USA – she used her speech to call for all Indian schools and universities to teach human rights in a practical way, so people understand and can benefit from the Indian Constitution. \n☝️Photo – Sheena Chohan with the President’s Lifetime Achievement Award – signed by US President Biden \nBecause Sheena Chohan comes up number one on Google if you search “Indian Actor Human Rights”, she was personally asked by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, to help promote the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Sheena is the only Indian celebrity followed by Volker Türk’s official office on Instagram (instagram.com/unitednationshumanrights). \nSheena took High Commissioner Türk’s request to heart and received the award from President Biden for spreading awareness of basic rights and equality to over 170 million people. \nSheena said: “Human Rights are the way to create a decent society of peace and equality and the most important way to achieve that is through awareness and education campaigns. My podcast, Born Free & Equal, which teamed up with artists like Preety Zinta, Sonakshi Sinha, Raveena Tandon, Sonu Sood, Sanjana Sanghi, Imtiaz Ali and more, spread awareness of basic rights and equality to over a hundred million people during lockdown, but it’s nowhere near enough! India is the most populous and youthful country in the world – we need our youth to completely understand their rights, and in a way that’s in line with the excellent new National Education Policy. Our rights must be taught so they are understood – which means looking up the hard to understand words in a dictionary and giving real life examples so children and young people actually understand what No Discrimination or the other rights like Social Security, No Torture, No Slavery, etc., mean.” \nSheena was previously given the Human Rights Hero Award at the United Nations in New York, partly for her work getting human rights education into the curriculums of over 100 schools and universities. She continued: \n“United for Human Rights (www.humanrights.com) has made each of the 30 human rights into Hollywood quality films and dubbed them in Hindi and gives free education kits to any school or university in the world. India has one of the finest constitutions on the planet – it contains all of the rights and responsibilities that the laws of our land are based on. It’s the most important information that all citizens must know – so it must become mandatory in all Indian schools and universities!” \nOn the work front Sheena is in America shooting, while she waits for her Hollywood launch in a film directed by Taron Lexton which tied the Guinness Book of World Records for the film shot in the most countries. Last week Sheena’s Hindi film Amar Prem was launched in the official Indian pavilion at the world’s most prestigious film festival – Cannes. \nSheena returns to India in mid-June to finish shooting for a web-series where she plays a negative lead and the launch of her Hindi debut – Sant Tukaram , where she plays the lead female role alongside Subodh Bhave in Aditya Om’s Hindi Historical Drama – Sant Tukaram. \nSheena was last seen on Netflix’s Fame Game, alongside Madhuri Dixit, Disney Hot Star’s The Trial alongside Kajol and she was nominated for Best Actress for her lead role in Ant Story, which was bought by Netflix. \nThe post Sheena Chohan Accepts Award from US President Biden – Calls for Mandatory Human Rights Education in India appeared first on Bollywood Couch.",

				"title": "Sheena Chohan Accepts Award from US President Biden - Calls for Mandatory Human Rights Education in India",
				"text": "Actress Sheena Chohan was given The President’s Lifetime Achievement Award from the President of the United States, Joseph Biden, at a ceremony on 8th June in the USA - she used her speech to call for all Indian schools and universities to teach human rights in a practical way, so people understand and can benefit from the Indian Constitution.                                     ☝️Photo – Sheena Chohan with the President’s Lifetime Achievement Award – signed by US President Biden Because Sheena Chohan comes up number one on Google if you search “Indian Actor Human Rights”, she was personally asked by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, to help promote the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Sheena is the only Indian celebrity followed by Volker Türk’s official office on Instagram (instagram.com/unitednationshumanrights). Sheena took High Commissioner Türk’s request to heart and received the award from President Biden for spreading awareness of basic rights and equality to over 170 million people.  Sheena said: “Human Rights are the way to create a decent society of peace and equality and the most important way to achieve that is through awareness and education campaigns. My podcast, Born Free & Equal, which teamed up with artists like Preety Zinta, Sonakshi Sinha, Raveena Tandon, Sonu Sood, Sanjana Sanghi, Imtiaz Ali and more, spread awareness of basic rights and equality to over a hundred million people during lockdown, but it’s nowhere near enough! India is the most populous and youthful country in the world – we need our youth to completely understand their rights, and in a way that’s in line with the excellent new National Education Policy. Our rights must be taught so they are understood – which means looking up the hard to understand words in a dictionary and giving real life examples so children and young people actually understand what No Discrimination or the other rights like Social Security, No Torture, No Slavery, etc., mean.”  Sheena was previously given the Human Rights Hero Award at the United Nations in New York, partly for her work getting human rights education into the curriculums of over 100 schools and universities. She continued: “United for Human Rights (www.humanrights.com) has made each of the 30 human rights into Hollywood quality films and dubbed them in Hindi and gives free education kits to any school or university in the world. India has one of the finest constitutions on the planet - it contains all of the rights and responsibilities that the laws of our land are based on. It’s the most important information that all citizens must know – so it must become mandatory in all Indian schools and universities!” On the work front Sheena is in America shooting, while she waits for her Hollywood launch in a film directed by Taron Lexton which tied the Guinness Book of World Records for the film shot in the most countries. Last week Sheena’s Hindi film Amar Prem was launched in the official Indian pavilion at the world’s most prestigious film festival – Cannes. Sheena returns to India in mid-June to finish shooting for a web-series where she plays a negative lead and the launch of her Hindi debut – Sant Tukaram , where she plays the lead female role alongside Subodh Bhave in Aditya Om’s Hindi Historical Drama – Sant Tukaram. Sheena was last seen on Netflix’s Fame Game, alongside Madhuri Dixit, Disney Hot Star’s The Trial alongside Kajol and she was nominated for Best Actress for her lead role in Ant Story, which was bought by Netflix.",

				"text": "hi ^^ i know u said i dont have to post this but i think i just wanted to clear some things up as well :> [[MORE]]firstly, i do agree that there is nothing wrong with 14 year olds having a political opinion. what i think that anon meant is probably that some people or in this case, kids, follow whatever is posted online about politics. they're free to like a political leader and dislike the other but most of the time, again from what i've seen around me including my experience with my brother and a few of his friends, their reasoning for disliking modi is like ... just because. as in, oh just because this person said so. and i see this a lot. i'm not saying everyone is like this, but what i feel is that the previous anon was particularly talking about those who join the hate train without any idea of what's happening and not actually against the kids having / participating in any kind of political discussion secondly, i quite literally have no opinion on that one since i haven't actually seen anyone calling modi the said 'horrible names' ( in terms of profanities or other vulgar / sensitive terms ) i just think it's one's own decision how they want to perceive these leaders and how much they idolise them lastly, yes! he is pro-hindu and he basically rode this hindu-muslim agenda the entire election. and he's playing this two-faced game where in one state, he says he doesn't believe in religious differences while in another state, he says something along the lines of “we can identify these disturbing public elements just by their clothes” which we know is clearly targeted at their way of dressing. and saying all this in a country that has terrible relations with islamic country/ies is not exactly smart because he's basically setting up the people against themselves ( like i've seen people around me talk like all muslims follow the terrorism agenda. even parents tell their kids to be wary of their muslim classmates and not be close to them ) about the genocide— that is also true. india has good relations with israel and even though modi said they're 'neutral' and won't pick a side in this ( which i know is not a choice here ) it's quite clear he's just trying to save his relations with netanyahu while also wanting to be seen as a country that doesn't support genocide / has no stance in this. i haven't seen a single news channel talk about the genocide, not a single indian celebrity aside from a few mentioning it and we definitely don't talk about it as much as we should. i think it's also the public's fault for being silent, but mostly the media for putting it in a way where most of the people would support israel",
